The part of a machine learning system that
learns and makes predictions is called a model. Neural networks and random forests are examples of models

The examples that the system uses to learn are called the training set. Each training example is called a training instance (or sample).

machine learning can help humans learn. ML models
can be inspected to see what they have learned (although for some models
this can be tricky). For instance, once a spam filter has been trained on
enough spam, it can easily be inspected to reveal the list of words and
combinations of words that it believes are the best predictors of spam.
Sometimes this will reveal unsuspected correlations or new trends, and
thereby lead to a better understanding of the problem. Digging into large
amounts of data to discover hidden patterns is called data mining, and
machine learning excels at it.
