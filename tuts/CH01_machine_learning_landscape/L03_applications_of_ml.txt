# Examples of Applications

Let’s look at some concrete examples of machine learning tasks, along with
the techniques that can tackle them:

Analyzing images of products on a production line to automatically classify
them
This is image classification, typically performed using convolutional
neural networks (CNNs; see Chapter 14) or sometimes transformers
(see Chapter 16).

Detecting tumors in brain scans
This is semantic image segmentation, where each pixel in the image is
classified (as we want to determine the exact location and shape of
tumors), typically using CNNs or transformers.

Automatically classifying news articles
This is natural language processing (NLP), and more specifically text
classification, which can be tackled using recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) and CNNs, but transformers work even better (see Chapter 16).

Automatically flagging offensive comments on discussion forums
This is also text classification, using the same NLP tools.

Summarizing long documents automatically
This is a branch of NLP called text summarization, again using the same
tools.

Creating a chatbot or a personal assistant
This involves many NLP components, including natural language
understanding (NLU) and question-answering modules.

Forecasting your company’s revenue next year, based on many performance
metrics
This is a regression task (i.e., predicting values) that may be tackled
using any regression model, such as a linear regression or polynomial
regression model (see Chapter 4), a regression support vector machine
(see Chapter 5), a regression random forest (see Chapter 7), or an
artificial neural network (see Chapter 10). If you want to take into
account sequences of past performance metrics, you may want to use
RNNs, CNNs, or transformers (see Chapters 15 and 16).

# Making your app react to voice commands
This is speech recognition, which requires processing audio samples:
since they are long and complex sequences, they are typically processed
using RNNs, CNNs, or transformers (see Chapters 15 and 16).

# Detecting credit card fraud
This is anomaly detection, which can be tackled using isolation forests,
Gaussian mixture models (see Chapter 9), or autoencoders (see
Chapter 17).

# Segmenting clients based on their purchases so that you can design a
different marketing strategy for each segment
This is clustering, which can be achieved using k-means, DBSCAN, and
more (see Chapter 9).

# Representing a complex, high-dimensional dataset in a clear and insightful
diagram
This is data visualization, often involving dimensionality reduction
techniques (see Chapter 8).

# Recommending a product that a client may be interested in, based on past
purchases
This is a recommender system. One approach is to feed past purchases
(and other information about the client) to an artificial neural network
(see Chapter 10), and get it to output the most likely next purchase. This
neural net would typically be trained on past sequences of purchases
across all clients.

#  Building an intelligent bot for a game
This is often tackled using reinforcement learning (RL; see Chapter 18),
which is a branch of machine learning that trains agents (such as bots)
to pick the actions that will maximize their rewards over time (e.g., a
bot may get a reward every time the player loses some life points),
within a given environment (such as the game). The famous AlphaGo
program that beat the world champion at the game of Go was built using
RL.
