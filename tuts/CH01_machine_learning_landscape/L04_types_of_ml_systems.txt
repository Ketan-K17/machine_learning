There's 3 - 

1. How they're supervised during training - 
    - Supervised learning
    - Unsupervised learning
    - Semi-supervised learning
    - Reinforcement learning
    a few others.....

2. Whether they can learn incrementally on the fly or in batches - 
    - Online learning
    - Batch learning

3. Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known
data points, or instead by detecting patterns in the training data and
building a predictive model, much like scientists do (instance-based
versus model-based learning)


NOTE: These criteria are not exclusive; you can combine them in any way you like.
For example, a state-of-the-art spam filter may learn on the fly using a deep
neural network model trained using human-provided examples of spam and
ham; this makes it an online, model-based, supervised learning system.
