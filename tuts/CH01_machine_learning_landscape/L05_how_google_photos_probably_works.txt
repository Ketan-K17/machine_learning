Some photo-hosting services, such as Google Photos, are good examples of
this. Once you upload all your family photos to the service, it automatically
recognizes that the same person A shows up in photos 1, 5, and 11, while
another person B shows up in photos 2, 5, and 7. This is the unsupervised
part of the algorithm (clustering). Now all the system needs is for you to tell
it who these people are. Just add one label per person and it is able to name
everyone in every photo, which is useful for searching photos.
