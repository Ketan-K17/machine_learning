Possibly the most trivial form of learning is simply to learn by heart. If you
were to create a spam filter this way, it would just flag all emails that are
identical to emails that have already been flagged by usersâ€”not the worst
solution, but certainly not the best.
Instead of just flagging emails that are identical to known spam emails,
your spam filter could be programmed to also flag emails that are very
similar to known spam emails. This requires a measure of similarity
between two emails. A (very basic) similarity measure between two emails
could be to count the number of words they have in common. The system
would flag an email as spam if it has many words in common with a known
spam email.
This is called instance-based learning: the system learns the examples by
heart, then generalizes to new cases by using a similarity measure to
compare them to the learned examples (or a subset of them).
