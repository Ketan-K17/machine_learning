THE UNREASONABLE EFFECTIVENESS OF DATA

In a famous paper published in 2001, Microsoft researchers Michele
Banko and Eric Brill showed that very different machine learning
algorithms, including fairly simple ones, performed almost identically
well on a complex problem of natural language disambiguation once
they were given enough data (as you can see in Figure 1-21).
As the authors put it, “these results suggest that we may want to
reconsider the trade-off between spending time and money on algorithm
development versus spending it on corpus development”.
The idea that data matters more than algorithms for complex problems
was further popularized by Peter Norvig et al. in a paper titled “The
Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data”, published in 2009. It should be
noted, however, that small and medium-sized datasets are still very
common, and it is not always easy or cheap to get extra training data—
so don’t abandon algorithms just yet.
